Food was good, the service was pretty slow even though there were only 3 tables booked the whole time we were there. Another thing I’d like to point out to the manager / owner of the place. We had 2 waiters serve us, the young one was fine and did his job fine, then an older one started serving us right at the end and he is also the one that bought the bill out which was a total of 1,250. I asked him to also bring the card machine over, he bought the card machine and said “maam the bill doesn’t include any service tax so would you like to give 50 as the tip?” I said “okay” and then he typed in a total of “1,500” and I looked at that before inserting my card and asked him “250 in just tip?” He looked at me and just nodded. So I confusingly agreed..\nI don’t agree with this amount and that he just typed it in himself on the machine rather than handing me the machine. I’ve been in Mumbai now for about 10 days and every restaurant I have been to has included service tax on the invoice and if I truly liked the service I always would leave a tip where necessary. But in also saying that, I’ve never heard of a 20% tip.. please let the manager or owner of the place read this as it leaves a sour taste in anyone’s mouth especially if they are foreigners to feel a bit cheated like this.. it’s not about the money, it’s just morally not correct. Just because someone doesn’t speak your language or understand the taxes in the country, doesn’t mean you can take advantage of that. And then my friends asked me the next day at a party about how I liked her lunch suggested place and I had to tell everyone this unfortunate event, so this also creates a bad name for the honesty of the restaurant through word of mouth.

The decor has a classic, Indian touch, creating an inviting atmosphere that complements the culinary journey.\n\nOne of the highlights of Kailash Parbat is its extensive and diverse menu.

Another standout is the Ragda Pattice, a lesser-known dish that is packed with a unique blend of spices and textures.\n\nKailash Parbat also caters to a wide range of dietary preferences, including plenty of vegetarian options, which makes it a fantastic choice for those with specific dietary needs.

Tucked away along the quieter back road, this outlet offers the perfect blend of a trendy café and a lively bar — a space where laid-back daytime vibes seamlessly transition into an electric nightlife atmosphere.\nPros:\n1. The ambience is a total winner — spacious, vibrant, and welcoming. From the warm colour tones to the comfy seating and a small dance floor, the place instantly sets a good vibe.\n2. Fresh, flavorful food that lives up to expectations with every bite.\n3. Generous portions, perfect for sharing between two people.\n4. Service that’s quick, attentive, and genuinely adds to the dining experience.\nCons:\nHonestly, none that stood out.\n\nWhat we ordered;\n🔸️ Hazel; RECOMMENDED\nA chocolate base mocktail, which had vanilla icecream blended along with hazelnut and coffee. I had ordered it for the very first time, and it didn't disappoint me though. Only one problem, could have been served in some other glass.\nRating: 4/5\n\n🔸️ Nuttela Freakshake;\nWhat could have been different than the name itself? Nuttela Milkshake make thick with addition of ice crushes, added along with some kitkats, whip cream on the top and some gems as usual, making it a big freakshake as its name goes.\nRating: 3/5\n\n🔸️ Mushroom on Toast; HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\nThis bruschetta was something you shouldn't miss out on. Mushroom with cheese and herbs been placed on a toasted loaf of bread. Try it out yourself if you havent ever tried bruchetta ever.\nRating: 4.5/5\n\n🔸️ Gojuchang Glazed Chicken: RECOMMENDED\nThe Sweet and Sour Korean's famous chicken dish which most of you guys would love. One of the most loved chicken starter here, served along with a sweet sour ketchup and topped with seseme seeds.\nRating: 4/5\n\n🔸️ Pasta in Pink Sauce; RECOMMENDED\nDecent taste of any regular pink pasta sauce, which added exotic veges and perfect consistency. Might go for this italian dish as it is the most regular ordered dish.\nRating: 4/5\n\n🔸️ Chocolate Truffle cake; RECOMMENDED\nA chocolate mousse cake along with a side of an icecream scoop was nothing special though. But after the first bite the mousse melts in your mouth. Definitely worth remembering the taste. Best tasted with vanilla icecream combo.\nRating: 4/5\n\nFinal Verdict:\nEvery place has its highs and lows, but this one truly leaves more reasons to love than to complain about. Pricing is on par with most popular cafés, making it easy on the pocket without compromising on the experience. The food quality and quantity hit the mark for any true foodie, and it’s clear the team works hard to deliver on every front.

After starting the service she said I have upgraded your facial but the difference is just 500 rs and she will do eyebrows too. I thought she is providing me that in same package. But later in final billing she charged me 1700 rs extra, saying sorry there was some misunderstanding🙄. Same with global color.

Why can't you give clear details to customers rather than fooling them like this?\n\nFinal billing experience was too shocking.

Great hair wash by Vivek\n2. I went back for highlights. I want to say the stylists and the salon itself is very good, but was disappointed by the process. I chose an ash color highlight, Pravin did a test and it looked good. This process was supposed to be 3 hours, however, I was there for close to 5 (I do have long, thick hair). I could tell that something was amiss when the stylists kept looking over and checking my color. When the hair was washed, I couldn't see the highlight at all, not even subtle. I mentioned this to the stylist and he said it would get lighter with a few washes. I've washed my hair a few times now, and you cannot see the highlights AT ALL. I feel like I wasted my time & my money. Unfortunately, I did this the day I was flying home to Canada, if not, I would have returned to the salon and asked for a refund. I hate to give a bad review as the salon and the staff are very good, but if I spend time and money on highlights and don't get highlights, it's very unfair.

Portions are satisfying, and while the flavours are enjoyable, they may not leave a lasting impression. The pricing is a bit on the higher side, so keep that in mind when planning your outing.\n\nOne area for improvement is the service. During my visit, there were only 2-3 waiters on hand, which slowed things down, particularly during peak hours.

She was suffering from persistent back, hip, and knee pain, which had significantly affected her quality of life. From the very first consultation, Dr. Gautam Shetty, Dr. Naemah Ansari, Dr. Nayanika Das Adhikari, and Dr. Gauri Aswadekar provided thorough assessments and personalized treatment plans that were both effective and reassuring. Their expertise and compassionate approach gave us great confidence throughout the process.\n\nWhat stood out the most was the remarkable improvement my mother experienced in just four sessions. Her pain has almost completely disappeared, and she is now able to move more freely and comfortably. The doctors were attentive, patient, and very clear in explaining every step of the treatment, ensuring we understood the process and expected outcomes. Their professionalism combined with a genuine concern for patient well-being made all the difference.\n\nAdditionally, the support staff and housekeeping at QI Spine Clinic were extremely courteous, organized, and helpful. The entire environment was clean, well-maintained, and welcoming, which added to the positive experience.

What if all this comes under a single roof and one gets a bit of everything.\n\nLocated in the midst of the business district of Andheri, off the New Link road is this place named BOVEDA [pronounced as Bo Vay Dah]. A quick search on Google revealed that the word is synonymous with “Vault” in Spanish. What an apropos name for the place!\n\nThis place is indeed a vault which holds within itself loads of surprises, good food & drinks, some activities that keep happening around the week, art, music etc. It’s been 2 ½ years since they started shop and they have gained a name within that short span of time. From the moment you step inside the wooden gates, the place gives out vibes of energy and rawness.\n\nService was with warm, attentive and quick. We were personally attended by Saqib Duggal who made sure we had the best food and served at appropriate intervals.\n\nThe place was pretty empty when we walked in at around 8 pm but by the time we were winding up; by 9.30 pm, people were walking-in in good numbers. This energetic and rustic place has ticked most boxes on my list and is sure to be liked for one or various reasons.\n\nMUST HAVE:\n- Cottage Cheese Picata\n- Smoked Cheese & Spinach Pizza\n- Pomodoro Pasta", "time": "8 years ago"}, {"author": "coco", "rating": 4, "text": "Strings of tiny orange-yellow lights peeked at us from behind a delicate wooden framework. Peppy, classical music made the place thick with a happy air, adding more to just that extra something in the ambience we couldn't place a finger on.\nWe decided to try the Baked Beans on Toast and we were extremely delighted by our choice. The bread was done just perfectly where it was neither too crispy nor too soft. It complimented the beans most appropriately. The beans had a tangy sweet sour taste with a hint of garlic which made them really worth a meal. They also had baked tomatoes and mushrooms as sides which were impeccably soft as well as spiced with pepper and herbs thus completing the dish.\nWe had their Eggs Benedict with Bacon. This was very elegant with a base of sweetened bun, topped with salty bacon over each, the Egg Benedict rested. The Egg Benedict was oozing out rich liquid yellow yolk and it was edged by the fluffiest white. Everything was topped with Spinach leaves!\nWe also tried the Waffles which were correctly hard as well as a little crispy on the outside, and extremely soft and sweet on the inside. They were topped with Dusted Icing Sugar. The waffles were served with sides of maple syrup, whipped cream and banana caramel with classic lemon crème brulee. The taste of caramel in the banana caramel was a little less. However, the waffles were baked to perfection which gave them a perfect tinge of tempting baked brown colour.\nOne of their intriguing sandwiches was the Plum Tomato, Mozzerella, Collorosso, Basil Pesto, Balsamic Reduction Sandwich. It had an exotic flavour of the balsamic reduction which was the essence of the sandwich. The collorosso was the softest and it blended along with the balsamic and the plum and tomato juices. The crisp was added by kale and the lettuce which balanced the soft and sloppy tomatoes. The bread was fresh with flour dust. Although their fries could have been better, their presentation topped it all.\nWe also had Prawns with Basil. The prawns were nice and juicy. They come with a strong garlic and paprika base. Their presentation is spot on. The prawns stayed true to themselves with a remainder of a bit of a shell at the end. We also had Paprika Chicken. This came with a thick paste of mint chutney. They came on long wooden stems and tasted strongly like paprika. Their quantity for this dish is generous.\nWe had quite a bunch of mocktails too. The star drink was Black Vanilla. It stole our hearts at the first sip. Vanilla flavoured strawberry shake along with some hidden secret elements definitely made this one drool worthy. It was topped with cream and the vanilla just caught the correct flavour. Although oreo and mint isn't that great a combination but when we tried their Mint Oreo Milkshake, they quite nailed it too. To begin with, the taste was a bit high on the mint but towards the end with the oreo overpowering it, it turned out to be extremely tasty.\nComing to the Elderflower and Blueberry Iced Tea, the strong essence of elderflower was definitely overpowering. This one was extremely refreshing and quite certainly stirred us up.\nMoving forward to the desserts, we were served Tiramisu. Tiramisu was delicious. It was amazing with just the right amount of coffee in those creamy, frothy layers. The presentation again was beautiful with the top of the tiramisu dot layers plucked for design. The Gooey Chocolate Brownie was heaven on a plate. We think we might have just found the softest, gooeist and the most mouth-watering brownie. Our spoons just sunk into it and this one definitely did melt into our souls.\nAll in all, this place will definitely leave you smiling with its infectiously happy aura. Their food has genuine taste. Their service could be a touch better. Would we recommend it? Most definitely!

Most of the assessment and documentation were carried out by Dr. Prateeksha Deshpande and Dr. Prafulla Borekar, two neurology residents — not by Dr. Bhatt himself.\n\nDespite being one of the few specialists in India dealing with functional and movement disorders, Dr. Bhatt’s conduct and approach were shockingly dismissive. His seniority in such a rare field seems to have made him unaccountable rather than responsible — his evaluation was rushed, impersonal, and devoid of the empathy expected from a doctor of his stature. Patients and families come to him seeking clarity and reassurance, not quick judgments or blanket conclusions.\n\nThe team initially refused to perform an MRI of the brain, claiming it wasn’t necessary. Only after repeated insistence did they agree. The discharge summary that followed felt as though it was written to fit a predetermined diagnosis rather than explore all possible causes.\n\nEven more concerning is that many of the findings within the same discharge summary actually contradict the ALS diagnosis that Dr. Bhatt and his team concluded. Basic neurological observations and examination results mentioned in the report don’t align with what would typically support such a serious diagnosis.\n\nDr. Bhatt merely signed the report as a “Consultant Neurologist”, while the detailed notes and interpretations were prepared by the residents. No spinal MRI was ordered, despite her long-standing lower-limb and gait issues. Yet a definitive ALS label was confidently declared after one brief encounter — a conclusion that multiple other senior neurologists have since questioned.\n\nTo anyone seeking treatment here: please be extremely cautious. Do not accept a life-changing diagnosis without a comprehensive evaluation, full testing, and senior-level involvement. Ensure that the consultant you are paying to see actually conducts the examination personally.\n\nHospitals and specialists must remember that they are dealing with people’s lives, not just case files.

Talking about the ambience it’s a perfect and an ideal date place having that cosy warm lighting set up with couch, high chair and a few sofa seatings. Loved the vibe overall of this place! Coming to the f&b, in drinks we ordered for Garden of Nara which was gin base having that perfect refreshing flavor to it coming from cucumber and basil. Next we had Spicy spin which was tequila and passionfruit puree and as the name suggests it also has spicy elements like tabasco, coriander and jalapeños making it very well balanced drink. The presentation was top notch too as it had passionfruit boba served on top. For the second round of drinks we ordered for Era of Geisha which a mix of Gin, Jasmine Green Tea, Pandan & Jasmine Infused Syrup, Orange blossom water and lime juice. the mixologist had done an incredible job in this one and it’s a must try if you are here. Lastly we also tried Seoul Ful which was a mix Green Apple Soju, Gin, Campari, Fresh Grapes, Lime Juice & Peach Syrup. Inspired from Koreas mixology this was hands down one of the best drink we have tried off-late. For the appetisers we ordered for Crispy Avocado Roll which was very well made and had that perfect crisp coming from tempura and richness from the avocado. This was probably the best vegetarian sushi I have had. Next we tried Classic Truffle chicken tikka which was their take on traditional tikka and incorporating truffle into it. Loved the fusion! For mains we had butter chicken with garlic naan - the best part about this butter chicken that it was perfectly sweet and it retained all the spices making it the ideal butter chicken you would expect. Not too sweet and not too spicy - just perfect. We also tried penang curry which was served with bread and jasmine rice. Rich in consistency and texture this curry would definitely be your favourite one if you are here. For our sweet tooth we orders for Tres Leches which was fresh and had that perfect melt in the mouth texture to it. Loved it! Overall the experience was fabulous as the hospitality is flawless.

The place is centered around the “bar” aspect, and is a little dingy/shady. However, their chicken lollipop is fairly good. Portion size is for 2 people for every dish. Decent option to pick up common starters. ₹200-250 per non-veg dish, but there may be a little fluctuation. Vegetarian dishes aren’t much cheaper, basically within ₹30-50 of their non-veg counterparts. Don’t follow the menu pictures uploaded, everything is at least 50-70% higher priced than that.\n\nThe negatives are the crowd, since there will be people drinking almost every time of the day. The lower level is basically for drinkers/smokers. If you’re going here for drinking & smoking with some other guys then I guess you’ll be fine. However, this is not really a “family restaurant” due to the atmosphere. Upper level is quiet outside rush hours(presumably 12:00-2:00pm & post work hours), but the lighting is dim. This is the only option unless you don’t mind cigarette smoke. It has AC so the air gets filtered, and nobody was smoking when I went. Basically single guys all around. Based on the atmosphere, I would have given it 2 stars for anyone going with family.\n\nHowever, the positive aspect improved my rating. The starters, especially the standard common starters are quite good. However, their noodles are oily. Given that people eat a bunch of oily food with alcohol, it’s not surprising. If you were to simply pick up standard starters, you might find it worth 4 stars or above. Given the very active bar, these options are also bound to be decently fresh.

Even at the time of order I didn't negotiated even once on the prices just asked or you  can say requested to please make it beautiful & charming , just like my daughter :), adding to that the delivery was an hour late , they were waiting for these paper butterfly ,  non edible by the way. and the owner was confident that your cake was looking beautiful sir, i think he was sarcastic , cause if i made this as per the reference than i can't say this even matched 25% of it.  well i can keep going but should end this now.\n\nHugely disappointed , expensive , taste is same as all the bakery nothing special. will not recommend this shop if you are going for any artisan cake or 3d cake.

We visited this place last weekend for lunch and had a lovely experience dining here. Talking about the ambience it’s pretty elegant having cosy corners and fresh vibe throughout. Coming to the F&B, in drinks we tried Botanic Breeze which was watermelon g&t which was 10/10 for the taste. The presentation was equally good! From mocktails we had Sapphire velvet which was mix of litchi, elderflower and blue curacao syrup. Super refreshing and perfect to quench your thirst. For the appetisers we tried bang bang prawns which was deep fried golden prawns drenched in sauce! Loved it and the presentation where it was served in a glass makes it totally gram worthy. Next we had khaas paneer tikka which was mild and had subtle spices with dominant Smokey flavour. Truly a must try if you are here! Later for the mains we had Khao Suey which was a solid 10. The portion size was so good that it would easily suffice 2-3 average eaters! Rich and velvety Khao Suey along with all the toppings made it to my top 3 list.
